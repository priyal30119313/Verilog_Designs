//  Consider a 1-bit equality comparator with two inputs, iO and il, and an output, eq.
//  The eq signal is asserted when iO and il are equal. The truth table of this circuit is shown below:

//  Assume that we want to use basic logic gates, which include not, and, or, and xor cells, 
to implement the circuit. One way to describe the circuit is to use a sum-of-products format. 
The logic expression is 
eq = iO . il + iO' . il'
